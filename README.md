# Listenbrainz_Dashboard
Dashboard created for the listenbrainz dataset. All data was taken from the listenbrainz dataset made public on the Bigquery Market Place. To save on data being processed I created my own subset that I chose to run analytics on.

To check out the Listenbrainz Dashboard I created please click [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/2461c59d-fbb7-4fb1-95c4-3bf69d5cc775).

Files here include: Listenbrainz DDL and a .csv subset of my data.
